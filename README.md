Demonstration of the effects of interference mitigation techniques on GNSS signal acquisition.

In this repository, you will find the material used to demonstrate the impact of five **interference mitigation techniques** on GNSS signal acquisition.
The techniques considered are:

- Adaptive Notch Filter (ANF)
- Frequency Domain Complex Signum (FDCS)
- Frequency Domain Pulse Blanking (FDPB)
- Time Domain Complex Signum (TDCS)
- Time Domain Pulse Blanking (TDPB)

The material has been prepared as part of the Institute of Navigation (ION) webinar ["GNSS interference mitigation: A measurement and position domain assessment"](https://www.ion.org/publications/webinars.cfm)
